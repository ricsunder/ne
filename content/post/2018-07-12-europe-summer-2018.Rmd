This restaurant was featured in [007 movie](http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Piz_Gloria) and offered spectacular views of all the major Alps peaks
* After lunch at the restaurant, we proceeded to [Birg Skywalk](https://vimeo.com/206105774). The sky walk will test your fear of heights. 
* The [Lauterbrunnen Valley](https://img.myswitzerland.com/mys/n65934/images/buehne/st0042708_wilderswil_lauterbrunnental.jpg) offered incredible views of the mountains and has 72 waterfalls. The most famous is the [Tr√ºmmelbach Falls](https://travelguide.michelin.com/sites/default/files/styles/poi_slideshow/public/images/travel_guide/voyage_media-NX-14590/trummelbach-waterfalls.jpg?itok=5rZwVXst)

##### Day 4

* After an amazing day at Schilthorn, it was onto Jungfraujoch. Also know as ["Top of Europe"](https://media.jungfrau.ch/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,c_crop,ar_1680:700/c_scale,w_1410/v1499772463/fileadmin/Jungfraujoch_Top_of_Europe/Jungfraujoch-Sphinx-Gletscher-Sonnenuntergang.jpg).
* We started early morning and were lucky to get seats on the train without reservation.
* We took the train from Grindelwald to Kleine Scheidegg, and then a special mountain [train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVxONJO3-rs) up to Jungfraujoch
* The train traveled through some of the best sceneries in Swizerland. We travelled through mountains, tunnels and enjoyed views of glaciers.
* After reaching the top we spent the whole day having fun on the snow.
* After getting down, we enjoyed good lunch at Kleine Scheidegg, and a short hike.
* After reaching the hotel around 4 pm, we still have the whole evning left and decided to take the train to Interlaken. We rented bicyles and strolled around the city and the lake.

##### Day 5

* On day 5 we decided to take the train to [Mount Titlis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvJj4BfD40). 
* We took the train from Interlaken to Engelberg and then a bus to Mount Titlis.
* On our way we passed through the beautiful town of [Lungern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYywGiwudk). After enjoying the mountains this town looked like a great way to relax. But we did not have time to do that. 
* Once we reached Mount Titlis we took the gondola to the top. After Schilthorn and Jungfraujoch, Titlis felt a little underwhelming.
* The facilities were not upto Swiss standards and nothing was open.
* We ate late lunch at an Indian restaurant and took the 3 hour train ride back to Grindelwald and got ready to say goodbye to the Jungfraujoch region

##### Day 6

* Left for Zermat
