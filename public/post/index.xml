      <description>Vermont &amp;amp; New Hampshire Trip Day 1 June 29  Landed at Newark Airport Ate Roti falafel for lunch Started driving toward New Haven Dinner at Frank Pepe Pizza Started driving towards Barnet, VT at around 8.00 pm Reached the rented house at 1.30 am. It was an adventure to locate the house late at night with no cell phone reception. The house was impressive, location was great and it was located in the woods.</description>
